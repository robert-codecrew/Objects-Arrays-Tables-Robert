#### Exercise 1
Create a constructor of Dog. Make sure it has the attributes name, breed, color, gender. There are no methods in this constructor. The main function below should work with the class you create.

```javascript

function main(){
	var newDog = new Dog("Fiddo", "Lab", "brown", "male");
	alert(newDog.name); 
	alert(newDog.breed);
	alert(newDog.color);
	alert(newDog.gender);
}

main();

```


#### Exercise 2
Create a ToDo constructor. Create the attributes: name, dueDate, list (this should be an array). There should not be a method in this class. The main function below should work with the class you create.

```javascript


function main(){
	newToDoList = new ToDo("Kenn", "Next Week", ["Do the dishes", "Wash your clothes"])
	print(newToDoList.list)
}

main();
```
